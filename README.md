# Lawn_Sensor

This is the Lawn Sensor Capstone Project developed by Team SP25-29. The website visualizes drone data using a modern, modular design. Our drone captures images of various plant species in lawns and, using machine learning, classifies them while measuring plant health, moisture, height, and leaf color. Explore the detailed data table, interactive map and gallery, and a suite of charts for an in-depth view of your lawn's vegetation.
